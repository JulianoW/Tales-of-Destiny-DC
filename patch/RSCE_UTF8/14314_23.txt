<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welp... my belly's full.
Let's head back.
[ENDBLOCK]
Gambler
[ENDBLOCK]
How're you guys doing tonight?
How about a little post-dinner
entertainment?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Who are you?
[ENDBLOCK]
Gambler
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, sorry! That was rude of me. I'm simply
a wandering gambler, going from town to
town, on a never-ending journey!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Cool! I didn't know people like you
existed! So what do you mean by
"entertainment?"
[ENDBLOCK]
Gambler
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a simple game. I throw
three dice, and you try to
guess what they add up to!
[ENDBLOCK]
Gambler
[ENDBLOCK]
If you're right, you'll win back
your gald and then some based
on the number you guessed!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm... So what
are the rates?
[ENDBLOCK]
Gambler
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, for instance, if you guess 10 and it
lands on 10, you get 7 times your gald
back. If you guess 18 and it lands on 18,
you get back 200 times your gald.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, hang on a sec!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Okay, so if he throws three dice
then the chance of them landing
such that they equal 10 is...12%!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...and 18 is...0.46%?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey wait a sec! Those odds
are massively in your favor,
aren't they?
[ENDBLOCK]
Gambler
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, come on now. I'm
just offering a little
bit of fun, here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Gambler
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't think so hard about it.
It's only a game, after all.
[ENDBLOCK]
Gambler
[ENDBLOCK]
Still, I don't think the
win rate is THAT bad...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is pointless. I'm not
wasting our gald on this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aw come on <Rutee>, can't
I try it at least once?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ugh, you're hopeless.
Fine, here...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh-!? One Gald!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're lucky I gave you THIS
much to throw away!
[ENDBLOCK]
Gambler
[ENDBLOCK]
So, what's your bet, sir?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hm... I got it! One Gald
on 18 please!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hold up, <Stahn>! You know you'd have
to roll 200 times for it to maybe come
up 18 just once right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I just wanna test my
luck, that's all!
[ENDBLOCK]
Gambler
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then, shall we?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way...
[ENDBLOCK]
Gambler
[ENDBLOCK]
Congratulations sir!
You win 200 gald.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Woohoo!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ugh! Why'd you only bet
one gald, you dope!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Dope!? <Rutee>,
you only-
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
No excuses!!
[ENDBLOCK]
Gambler
[ENDBLOCK]
Would you like to continue?
What's your next guess?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
All in on 18!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
THINK a little, <Stahn>! It's not
gonna land on 18 again!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But it's my lucky
number...
[ENDBLOCK]
Gambler
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then, shall we?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way...
[ENDBLOCK]
Gambler
[ENDBLOCK]
Congratulations sir! Your accurate
prediction has earned you a payout
of 40,000 Gald!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Woohoo!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Am... am I dreaming...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Gambler
[ENDBLOCK]
Would you like to continue?
What's your next guess?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
All in on 18!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>! I get it!
You're lucky!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
But please, PLEASE stop! There's
no way the dice'll add up to 18 a
THIRD time!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
C'mon, <Rutee>! Don't you know
the old saying "What happens
twice will happen thrice?"
[ENDBLOCK]
Gambler
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then, shall we?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way...
[ENDBLOCK]
Gambler
[ENDBLOCK]
Congratulations! With this,
your winnings come to...
[ENDBLOCK]
Gambler
[ENDBLOCK]
Eight Million Gald!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Woohoo!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Impossible...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Man am I lucky today.
Guess I'll stop for no-
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oww! <Rutee> what gives!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Keep it rolling! All in on 18!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>, we've won enough.
Shouldn't we stop?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way, idiot! It's your lucky
day right? Let's keep going!
[ENDBLOCK]
Gambler
[ENDBLOCK]
You want to
roll again?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, of course!
[ENDBLOCK]
Gambler
[ENDBLOCK]
Very well. Shall we?
[ENDBLOCK]
Gambler
[ENDBLOCK]
C-Congratulations, miss.
Th-This brings you to a
total earnings of...
[ENDBLOCK]
Gambler
[ENDBLOCK]
O-O-One billion six hundred million Gald...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
More! More! All in on 18, of course!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
R-<Rutee>, are you sure?
Maybe we oughta stop...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]

roll them bones!
[ENDBLOCK]
Gambler
[ENDBLOCK]
W-Well h-here it goes..
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...No way...!
[ENDBLOCK]
Gambler
[ENDBLOCK]
Ooh, too bad. A 17. You lose
all of your winnings.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Cheater! You cheated!!
[ENDBLOCK]
Gambler
[ENDBLOCK]
What!? Don't be absurd!
You could have stopped
while you were winning!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ohh nooo...
No, no, no...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>, give it up already.
It was bad luck.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, you all seem to be
excited over something.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've been here for
quite a while now...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>, you're all pale! What's
wrong? Did something happen?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes. A great loss. We've
lost one whole gald.
[ENDBLOCK]
