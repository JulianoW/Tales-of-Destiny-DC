I don't think I'm in the mood for
a straightforward approach.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Johnny>. You look kindaRight...
down about something.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Nah, nothing of the sort...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well now I know you're
hiding something!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come now, tell me everything.
I bet it's juicy!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahaha, well, aren't
you the honest one?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Very well, then.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I... that is, who "I" am now...
This is where I became "me."
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you mean?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
It was a long time ago... Let's
not linger here. Come on.
[ENDBLOCK]
Blonde Youth
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's see... I think
I hid it over here?
[ENDBLOCK]
Blonde Youth
[ENDBLOCK]
If she gets a look at
this, then surely...
[ENDBLOCK]

...t, ...ing that ma...hap..
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? Is someone upstairs?
[ENDBLOCK]
Blonde Youth
[ENDBLOCK]
Heh! If I focus, I can see
them in my mind's eye...
[ENDBLOCK]
Blonde Youth
[ENDBLOCK]
Now! Eyes... Open!
[ENDBLOCK]
????
[ENDBLOCK]
...But ...ny's...
[ENDBLOCK]
????
[ENDBLOCK]
No matter...this...you
and I are...for sure!
[ENDBLOCK]
Blonde Youth
[ENDBLOCK]
(Sounds like a man and a 
woman...) Is this a secret
date I'm spying on?
[ENDBLOCK]
Blonde Youth
[ENDBLOCK]
Lucky me!!
[ENDBLOCK]
Blonde Youth
[ENDBLOCK]
Concentrate! Focus! On!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
I... love...!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
So happy... but...
[ENDBLOCK]
Blonde Youth
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? Th-This voice...!
[ENDBLOCK]
????
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you feel the same
way about me?
[ENDBLOCK]
????
[ENDBLOCK]
I do... but, we should keep
silent about this to him...
[ENDBLOCK]
????
[ENDBLOCK]
...please.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is there a memory
stuck in this lens?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
Damn it all...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
What troubles you, Great
Emperor <Tiberius>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
And just who are you
supposed to be?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's just say that I'm
here to help you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph, do you expect to curry
favor with me by calling me
"Great Emperor <Tiberius>"?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
Not in the slightest. It's because
I know you will become Emperor
of all of Aquaveil!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hm? I will?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
Indeed. Therefore, you should
start acting the part.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
First, we must discredit
the Emperor of Shiden.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
And I know how... We will claim
he sent the treasured sword
of Aquaveil to Seinegald!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
There is no proof of this. The
people will never believe it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do not give up so easily.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
Before long, a young
man carrying this
sword will arrive.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
And then, after you become
Emperor, you'll order the
destruction of Seinegald!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
You speak as if it were a simple matter.
However, <Johnny> of Shiden and <Fayte>
of Moreau will not simply stand idle.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do not worry about that. My
associates have already taken
the necessary measures.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your time will soon come, Great
Emperor <Tiberius>. You who
have suffered so much.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see... Then I alone will
rule all of Aquaveil!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
He fell for such
an obvious trick.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Looks like <Tiberius>
was being used, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
And in the end, he... Well,
what's done is done.

Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice

<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this

Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
