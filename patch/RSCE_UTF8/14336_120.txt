[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
My Liege, here's the damage report
on the <Greybum> Rebellion.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you. I'll look over
it once I am able.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Majesty! I've prepared a list of
potential queen candidates. Please
be sure to read through them!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not sure I want to...
I mean, I'll be sure to.
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
My liege! The military budget for
this year has been drafted, and
is awaiting your approval!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Very well.
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Highness, I have submitted
a proposal regarding the castle
reserves. I hope you will consider it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you. I'll keep
that in mind.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
King <Woodrow>! I drew a picture
of you and your friends!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Really? I can't
wait to see it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
You already know his father, King
Isaac, passed away during the
<Greybum> Rebellion.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
And before that, his mother
succumbed to illness...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
King <Woodrow> was very young
when that happened. He locked
himself in his room, refusing to
leave.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
After three straight
days and nights...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
His father forced the door
open and dragged him out.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mild-mannered King
Isaac did that!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
He certainly did. He scolded
him harshly, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
"You have the nation in front of you
and the people behind you!," he said.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What does that mean?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
If the king stops walking, the
people will stumble and the
nation will never prosper.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That sounds
really tough...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Being a king means being between
a country and its people!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's why when Master Isaac died,
he was able to suppress his anger
and hold back his grief.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
He knew he had to escape,
that it was his duty to
Phandaria to survive.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it, my liege?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, it seems I've got
a lot of work to do.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Such matters are beneath you.
I'd be happy to handle them.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
That won't do. They asked
me personally for help.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
It won't take long, why don't
you wait here for me?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Gotcha.
Go get 'em!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>, can I ask
you a question?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What happened to
<Woodrow>'s family?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, it looks like
you're back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry to keep you
waiting. Let's go.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder if there's anyone that
shines bright enough for this...
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder if there's anyone that
shines bright enough for this...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Shines, huh?
Heh, I wonder...

[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, let's do it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yo! I'm the shining Star of all 
champions, Mighty <Kongman>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Woah! That posture! That confidence!
No doubt about it, you're a star!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So who exactly are you?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, excuse me! I'm thinking about
sponsoring a contest here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
If you were onboard with it, I 
know it'd draw a huge crowd!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
YEAH! Just leave it to me!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, uh, what kind of
contest, exactly?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
A strongman competition! I
call it the "Blizzard Bowl"!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
The contest will be tomorrow,
and we'll hold it here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then, let's rest here in
the castle until tomorrow!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone will be cheering you
on tomorrow, <Kongman>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, what's
going on here?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Seems no one showed up because
of the blizzard outside...
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
THE WINNER IS MIGHTY KONGMAN (Age 39)
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Congrats. Here is the
championship prize.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<center>WE HEREBY RECOGNIZE YOU, YETI, AS THE
INAUGURAL BLIZZARD BOWL CHAMPION.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm the Star of Champions,
not some Yeti! What gives!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome to our castle!
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Safe travels, Your Majesty!
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Take care, everyone!
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Leave defending the castle
to us, Your Majesty!
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Leave defending
the castle to us.
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I will not let this castle fall
again, no matter what.
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
If Belcrant hits
the castle...
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll protect the castle
at all costs.
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
How does it feel to
ride the Draconis?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
You're the ones from back then!
Thank you so much for your help!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
You're the ones who saved the
king! Thank you so much!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Majesty, please
be careful.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Have a good day. I'm counting on
you to take care of His Majesty.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
General <Darzen> is also here.
You don't have to worry.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Majesty!
You're safe!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
What's happening
to the sky?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Majesty, what
should I do now?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
We can count on King
<Woodrow> for this!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you get
enough lens?
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
His Majesty is
in the back.
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Safe travels, Your Majesty!
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
My liege! I look forward
to working with you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Nothing to report, sir!
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
So far, there has been
no significant damage
to our country.
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Damn! Phandaria was
hit by Belcrant!
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I won't let the monsters
invade this castle!
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Safe travels, Your Majesty!
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Be safe, everyone!
[ENDBLOCK]
Peddler
[ENDBLOCK]
The king here is very cordial. He's
very easy to do business with.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Your Majesty, thank you for this.
Thank you for everything.
[ENDBLOCK]
Peddler
[ENDBLOCK]
The king here is very cordial. He's
very easy to do business with.

lasts forever.
[ENDBLOCK]
Peddler
[ENDBLOCK]
Alas, peace is
so fleeting...
[ENDBLOCK]
Peddler
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm rooting for you,
King <Woodrow>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Peddler
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm rooting for
you guys!

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
