<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is there a memory
stuck in this lens?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
Damn it all...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
What troubles you, Great
Emperor <Tiberius>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
And just who are you
supposed to be?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's just say that I'm
here to help you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph, do you expect to curry
favor with me by calling me
"Great Emperor <Tiberius>"?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
Not in the slightest. It's because
I know you will become Emperor
of all of Aquaveil!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hm? I will?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
Indeed. Therefore, you should
start acting the part.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
First, we must discredit
the Emperor of Shiden.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
And I know how... We will claim
he sent the treasured sword
of Aquaveil to Seinegald!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
There is no proof of this. The
people will never believe it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do not give up so easily.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
Before long, a young
man carrying this
sword will arrive.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
And then, after you become
Emperor, you'll order the
destruction of Seinegald!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
You speak as if it were a simple matter.
However, <Johnny> of Shiden and <Fayte>
of Moreau will not simply stand idle.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do not worry about that. My
associates have already taken
the necessary measures.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your time will soon come, Great
Emperor <Tiberius>. You who
have suffered so much.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see... Then I alone will
rule all of Aquaveil!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
He fell for such
an obvious trick.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Looks like <Tiberius>
was being used, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
And in the end, he... Well,
what's done is done.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>!	<Greybum>!
We found you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
You...!	You're the
ones from Shiden!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny> the Clown makes
his surprise debut!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>... I didn't expect you
to follow me all this way.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm just trying to
fulfill my duty.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I must recover the Eye 
of Atamoni from you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
You impudent little...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Where is the Eye
of Atamoni?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't have to tell you anything!
Your Highness, take care of them!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
Indeed. Leave these fools to me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
You shall become mere
rust on my blade!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't believe... I lost...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Where's <Greybum>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's gone!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's that...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Outside!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Draconis!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It was here all along!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Where did it go!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did <Greybum> fly off on it...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Where'd <Greybum> run off to?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's going to Phandaria.
Heheh... looks like I was
fooled.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
This was his plan from the
start. I was nothing more 
than a pawn to him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
...And you wanted to be
the ruler of Aquaveil?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's pretty shameful, <Tiberius>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes... I may be even more
of a clown than you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
But...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I can't die like this. I am... the
Great Emperor of Aquaveil!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny> Shiden! I challenge you! One
final battle! A duel to the death!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you
talking about!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
...All right. I accept.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're royalty, after all. We have
our own way of settling things.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, may I borrow your
sword, just for a moment?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...No, use mine.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Since this is a duel between royalty,
it would be more fitting you use the
country's "Treasured Sword."
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Right, Chal?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Very well. As long as you
say so, Master <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm in your debt.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, then. Let's get started.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
Tell me, <Johnny>. What is
the real reason you've 
come here?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
Vengeance for <Eleanor>, perhaps?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
Or perhaps you wish to reclaim
the title of Emperor that I took
from your father?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Would you believe me if I
told you I was just helping
some friends out?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
Urrraaaaagghh!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Well said, <Johnny> the Clown.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've had my fill... of all of this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
You can have this back. I'm
hopeless with it, anyway.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>What does he mean he's "hopeless with
it?" That was not a lucky strike!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>, just what are you...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph. <Johnny> the Clown, huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord <Johnny>! Are you all right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've arrived just in time.
Spread the word. <Tiberius>
has fallen.
[ENDBLOCK]
At once, my liege!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, well. Let's get out of here.
<Fayte> will be waiting for us.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
