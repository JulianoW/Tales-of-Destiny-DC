Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome to Heidelberg Castle!
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
General <Darzen>
told me about you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome home,
Your Majesty!
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
This is the
audience hall.
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
All we can do is defend
this castle and the city.
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
We know you will return
triumphant, King <Woodrow>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone in the castle
knows who you are!
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone in the castle
knows who you are!
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I wish King <Woodrow>
the best in this fight!
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I wish you
the best of luck.
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems true peace
is still a ways off...
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Until peace is truly achieved,
we will wait patiently.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
The castle was damaged in
the <Greybum> Rebellion. It's
finally been repaired.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Majesty, please
take care of yourself.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Please take care of yourself.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
The goodwill between here and Cyril
has been restored. King <Woodrow>'s
rule will truly be a golden age.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I never thought
I'd see the day.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Majesty, you are not just the
pride of Phandaria. As far as I'm
concerned, you ARE Phandaria.
[ENDBLOCK]
Catgirl
[ENDBLOCK]
With my fine feminine charms, I'm
sure to win King <Woodrow>'s heart!
[ENDBLOCK]
Catgirl
[ENDBLOCK]
Ugh! It's impossible to get close
to the king with that little brat
hanging around him all the time!
[ENDBLOCK]
Catgirl
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, King <Woodrow>! You're
looking good today! What!?
That kid's still with you!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Catgirl
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, King <Woodrow>! You're
looking good today! What!?
That kid's still with you!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Catgirl
[ENDBLOCK]
Ugh! It's impossible to get close
to the king with that little brat
hanging around him all the time!
[ENDBLOCK]
Catgirl
[ENDBLOCK]
Eek! You're scary, Your Majesty...
N-No, never mind. It's nothing!
[ENDBLOCK]
Catgirl
[ENDBLOCK]
You're staring daggers at me! I'll
stop kidding around, I promise!
[ENDBLOCK]
Catgirl
[ENDBLOCK]
If only I could be by King
<Woodrow>'s side...
[ENDBLOCK]
Catgirl
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Majesty, we'll throw
a huge party for you
when you get back!
[ENDBLOCK]
Catgirl
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll have a big celebration once
everyone's back safe and sound!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
An ambush?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
I warned you to leave this land.
Why did you come here?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's something
I need to ask you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
...And with <Woodrow> Kelvin
at your side, no less.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
If that's how it is, I've got
only one answer for you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>, wait! <Mary>'s memory came
back! She remembers you now!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
...You waste your breath. 
Defend yourself!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why? Tell me why! Why
did you fight us!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>... You're just as
beautiful as you were
two years ago...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
You damned fool...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>, do you know what
<Greybum>'s real plan is?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I do.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then why!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, calm down. Let
<Mary> do the talking.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're right...
Sorry.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>, what
are you doing!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is he gonna...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>, no!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>, please step aside.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
On your feet,
<Dalis> Vincent.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
I am ready. I will
accept my fate.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Good.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>! Please stop!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not safe for you to
stay here. Hurry and
escape the castle.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
What...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
First, see to your wounds.
We'll talk more later.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you think
you're doing?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I will walk a different path than
my father. We will work together
for Phandaria's future.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
We will fight to the end over
what path our country takes.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Not with our blades,
but with our words.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
The son of Isaac the Wise is
even wiser than his father.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
I... I admit defeat.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>... <Dalis>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not leaving you!
I'll never leave you
again!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis> wasn't really working
with <Greybum>, was he?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>It's more likely that his name
was used for recruitment.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
How despicable!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>! I'll never
forgive you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Guys... I have a favor to ask.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I... I want to be with <Dalis>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>? You mean...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry... but I...
I'm home, now...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't want to be a warrior,
I just want to be <Dalis>' wife.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. Go ahead, <Mary>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. To say no when
you're so happy would be
downright awful of us.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Best of luck, you two!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Are you okay with this, Master <Lion>?
She's under arrest, after all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Hmph. I'll be sure to report it like
this: She was injured and we had 
no choice but to abandon her.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you, everyone...
I'm so lucky...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you for sparing <Dalis>' life.
I truly appreciate it from the very
bottom of my heart.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I should be the one thanking
you. Because of you, I'm more
prepared.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Prepared for what?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I know now what my responsibility
is, and I am ready to shoulder the
burdens of a ruler.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Therefore, first and foremost, we
must bring <Greybum> to justice.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're right.
Let's go!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
You guys! Please be safe!
I know you can do it!

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>[Rock Rally] is a game in which
